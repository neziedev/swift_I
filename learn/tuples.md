# Understanding Tuples in Swift

Tuples in Swift are a way of grouping multiple values into a single value. They can be used to store a collection of values in a single, compound data structure. Tuples are useful when you need to return multiple values from a function, or when you want to pass multiple values to a function.

# Creating a Tuple

Creating a tuple is easy in Swift. Simply enclose your values in parentheses and separate them with commas. Here's an example:

```
let student = (name: "John", age: 20, grade: "A")
```

## Accessing Tuple Values

To access the values of a tuple, you can use dot notation and the name of the value, or you can use index numbers. Here's an example using dot notation:

```
let name = student.name
let age = student.age
let grade = student.grade
```

And here's an example using index numbers:

```
let name = student.0
let age = student.1
let grade = student.2
```

## Decomposing Tuples

You can also decompose a tuple into separate values by using a tuple pattern in a switch statement or a pattern in an if statement. Here's an example:

```
switch student {
case let (name, age, grade):
print("Student name is (name)")
print("Student age is (age)")
print("Student grade is (grade)")
}
```
