# Start Your Swift Journey

In this course, you will learn key concepts such as variables, data types, mutability, conditional logic, looping, and function organization. By understanding these topics, we will be equipped to create efficient and organized code that can effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to expand your knowledge, this article will provide valuable insights into the core elements of Swift programming.

## Lesson 0 - Swift Basic Data Types:

Swift provides several basic data types that are commonly used when programming. The four most commonly used data types are `Int`, `Double`, `Bool`, and `String`.

## Lesson 1 - Variables

A variable is a container in which you can store a value in a computer program. In Swift, a variable is defined by a name and a type, and it can hold different values at different points in time.

Mutability refers to the ability of a variable to change its value. In other words, it determines whether a variable is read-only or can be modified. In Swift, you can use either let or var to define a variable.

## Lesson 2 - Conditional logic

Conditional logic in Swift is a way for your code to make decisions based on whether certain conditions are met. This allows your program to behave differently based on different inputs or states. For example, if you wanted to print a message only if a user is over 18, you could use a conditional statement to check their age and print the message only if the condition is true.
