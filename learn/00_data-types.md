# Swift Basic Data Types

Swift provides several basic data types that are commonly used when programming. The four most commonly used data types are `Int`, `Double`, `Bool`, and `String`.

## Int

An `Int` is a whole number. It can be positive, negative, or zero.

Example:

```
let age = 30
```

## Double

A `Double` is a floating-point number that can hold a fractional value. It is used to represent real numbers.

Example:

```
let height = 6.2
```

## Bool

A `Bool` is a data type that represents a boolean value, which is either `true` or `false`.

Example:

```
let isMale = true
```

## String

A `String` is a data type that represents a sequence of characters. It is used to represent text.

Example:

```
let name = "John"
```

It is important to understand the difference between these data types and choose the appropriate one when declaring variables or constants in your code.

## Resources to Learn Data Types in Swift

Swift is a type-safe programming language, which means that every variable and constant has a specific data type. Understanding data types in Swift is crucial to write efficient and correct code. Here are some resources that can help you learn data types in Swift:

1. [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swift-data-types)
   GeeksforGeeks is a well-known website that provides informative articles on various programming topics, including Swift. Their article on Swift data types is a comprehensive resource that covers all the basic and advanced data types in the language. The article is written in a clear and easy-to-understand manner, making it a great resource for both beginners and advanced Swift developers.

2. [Ray Wenderlich's Swift tutorials](https://www.kodeco.com/ios/paths)
   Ray Wenderlich is a well-known publisher of high-quality Swift tutorials. Their tutorials cover a wide range of topics, including data types in Swift. You can find beginner-friendly explanations and examples to help you understand the different data types.

3. [Apple's Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Types.html)
   This official resource from Apple provides an in-depth explanation of all the data types in Swift, including the basic data types (such as Int, Float, Double, etc.), collection types (such as arrays and dictionaries), and more complex data types (such as tuples and optionals).

These resources should provide a solid foundation for understanding data types in Swift. Start with the official documentation and then move on to the tutorials and practice problems to solidify your understanding. Happy learning!
